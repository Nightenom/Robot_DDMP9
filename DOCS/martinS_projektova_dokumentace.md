##Robot Hardware
####Design

The robot has a rectangular shape. It consists of a steel base  *x * y * z* large.
Movement is created by 4 wheels, each with its own electric motor with transmission.
The whole robot is powered by a 12V lead-acid battery.

####Electronics

##Remote Control

The robot is controlled remotely using an app called [RoboRemo](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hardcodedjoy.roboremo)

##Internal Communication

##Video feed trasmission

##Status Reporting

All tellemetry is reported through WiFi, separated from the video feed. It can be later overlayed over the video feed, or worked with seperately. A solution simmilar to (or the same) [freeboard](https://freeboard.io/)

####Location

####Temperature

####Battery Status

####Acceleration

##Collision Prevention

##Lights

##Black Box

##In case of losing control signal
~~Use a small ammount of explosives to deliver at least a part of the robot to the last known position, where it had control signal.~~
-not very economical
